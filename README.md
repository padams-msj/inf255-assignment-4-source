# Assignment 4 — Loading Data with async and npm

You will continue building the animal adoption app in this assignment, but instead of working with an array of local data, you will fetch the data from a json file. While fetching the data, your interface will display a "loading" message, and depending on the response, show the resulting list or an error message.

You will also refactor your code to work as a Vite project. This will allow you to easily configure a third-party library using npm and incorporate it into your app.

## Getting started

This repository contains a completed version of Assignment 3. You
can use this starter code or your own code from Assignment 3.

**To use your own Assignment 3 code:** after you set up this repository, copy
your Assignment 3 `script.js` over to this project. If you also changed
`index.html` or `style.css` for extra credit, copy those over too, then copy the
`.error-message` rule from the bottom of this project's `style.css` into yours.

Use this option only if your Assignment 3 works completely. If you aren't
sure, use the provided version.

## Files

- `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are the completed Assignment 3
  board.
- `public/animals.json` contains the shelter's animals as JSON. They are the
  same eight animals as before, with two new properties: `intakeDate`, the
  date the animal arrived at the shelter, and `breed`, which dogs have.
- `.gitignore` tells Git which files and folders to leave out of your
  repository. It's explained in TODO 1.

**Do not change the animal data in `animals.json`.** The expected results below
depend on it.

## Your tasks

Complete the five TODOs in order. Each one ends with a check. Don't move on
until the check works.

### TODO 1: Run the project with npm and Vite

We're going to migrate this app from LiveServer to Vite. Vite allows us to use `import` more easily.

Open the VS Code terminal in the project folder and work through these steps.

1. Create a `package.json` file:

   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install Vite:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev vite
   ```

   The `--save-dev` flag instructs `package.json` to mark Vite as a `devDependency` rather than a `dependency`. This is because Vite is only needed for developing the app, not for running it once it's done. 

3. In `package.json`, replace the `"scripts"` section with:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "vite",
     "build": "vite build",
     "preview": "vite preview"
   },
   ```

   Normally, when scaffolding a Vite project from scratch (using `npm create vite@latest`) these scripts are auto-generated. Since we are converting an existing codebase to work with Vite, they need to be added manually.

5. In `index.html`, change the script tag to:

   ```html
   <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
   ```

   `type="module"` lets `script.js` use `import` (TODO 4).

6. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Vite prints an address such as `http://localhost:5173/`. Ctrl+click it to
   open the page. Leave this terminal running while you work. To stop the
   server, click in the terminal and press **Ctrl+C**.

**About `node_modules`:** this folder holds Vite and everything Vite needs, and
it's large. It's never committed to Git, which is why the provided `.gitignore`
lists it. Anyone who clones your repository runs `npm install` to recreate it
from `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. **Do commit `package.json` and
`package-lock.json`.**

**Check:** the board works exactly as it did in Assignment 3, but now at the
`localhost` address from Vite. In GitHub Desktop or `git status`, you should see
`package.json` and `package-lock.json` as new files, and no `node_modules`.

### TODO 2: Remove the hard-coded animals

The animals now come from `public/animals.json`. Vite serves everything in
`public` from the root of the site. With the dev server running, visit
`http://localhost:5173/animals.json` to see the file.

In `script.js`:

1. Delete the `animals` array and replace it with an empty array:

   ```js
   let animals = [];
   ```

   It's `let` now, not `const`, because in TODO 3 you'll replace the whole
   array once the data arrives.

2. At the very bottom of the file, delete the two lines that display the
   animals when the page opens (`displayAnimals(animals);` and
   `updateCount();`). In TODO 3, you'll replace them.

**Check:** the page shows "There are no animals to show." and the count says
0 of 0. That's correct for now. The array is empty because nothing loads the
data yet.

### TODO 3: Load the animals with fetch

At the bottom of `script.js`, write an `async` function named `loadAnimals()`,
then call it so it runs when the page opens.

`loadAnimals()` must:

1. **Show a loading state.** Before the request starts, set the
   `#animal-count` paragraph to `Loading animals...` and clear
   `#animal-list`.
2. **Request the data.** Use `await fetch("/animals.json")` to request the
   file.
3. **Check the response.** If `response.ok` is `false`, throw an error, for
   example:

   ```js
   throw new Error(`Request failed with status ${response.status}`);
   ```

4. **Read the data.** Use `await response.json()` to turn the response into an
   array, store it in `animals`, and call `updateDisplay()`.
5. **Handle errors.** Wrap steps 2–4 in `try`/`catch`. In the `catch` block,
   log the error with `console.error()`, clear the count paragraph, and add a
   paragraph to `#animal-list` with the class `error-message` that says:

   ```
   Sorry, the animals couldn't be loaded. Try refreshing the page.
   ```

**Required comments:**

- Above your `fetch()` line, explain what `await` does. What is paused, and
  what keeps working while the page waits?
- Above your `response.ok` check, explain why the check is needed. (Hint: when
  does `fetch()` fail on its own, and when does it return a response that
  isn't what you wanted?)

**Check each state:**

- **Loaded:** refresh. All eight animals appear, and everything from
  Assignment 3 works. Use the expected results table below.
- **Loading:** the file loads too quickly to see the message. To slow it
  down, open DevTools (F12), select the **Network** tab, change **No
  throttling** to **3G**, and refresh. You should see `Loading animals...`
  before the cards appear. Set throttling back to **No throttling** when
  you're done.
- **Error:** temporarily change the path to `"/animal.json"` (no s) and
  refresh. You should see the error message, and the console should show the
  error. Change the path back.

**Why that error looks strange:** Vite answers a request for a file that doesn't
exist with the site's `index.html` page, not a 404 error. So `response.ok` is
`true`, and the error comes from `response.json()`, which can't read HTML:
`Unexpected token '<'`. Your `catch` block handles both kinds of failure. The
`response.ok` check matters with real servers, which do send a 404. You'll
build one later this semester.

### TODO 4: Use an npm package

Each card will show when the animal arrived at the shelter:

```
Arrived Aug 20, 2026 (48 days ago)
```

Dates are surprisingly hard to format and calculate with plain JavaScript, so
you'll use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) package.

1. Install it:

   ```
   npm install dayjs
   ```

   Look at `package.json` again. Day.js is listed under `"dependencies"`,
   while Vite is under `"devDependencies"`. Day.js runs in the browser as part
   of your app. Vite is only a tool you use while you build it.

2. At the very top of `script.js`, import it:

   ```js
   import dayjs from "dayjs";
   ```

3. In `displayAnimals()`, add a paragraph to each card showing the arrival
   date and the number of days since then. These two Day.js calls do the work:

   ```js
   dayjs(animal.intakeDate).format("MMM D, YYYY"); // "Aug 20, 2026"
   dayjs().diff(animal.intakeDate, "day");         // days from then until today
   ```

   `dayjs()` with nothing in the parentheses means right now.

**Check:** each card shows its arrival date. The dates match the table below.
The number of days depends on today's date, so yours will be larger than the
example.

**Try this:** open `index.html` with Live Server instead of Vite. The page
breaks, and the console says something like
`Failed to resolve module specifier "dayjs"`. The browser doesn't know where
to find `dayjs`. Vite does, because it reads `node_modules`. Close the Live
Server tab and go back to `npm run dev`.

### TODO 5: Document the project

Add a section at the **top** of this `README.md`, above the title, named
`## About this project`. It must include:

1. **How to run it.** The commands someone needs after cloning your
   repository, in order, and one sentence explaining why `npm install` is
   needed.
2. **Dependency check.** Run `npm run build`. Vite builds the finished site
   into a `dist` folder and lists the files it created with their sizes. Then
   answer, in a few sentences:
   - What does Day.js do for this project?
   - What is the size of the `.js` file that `npm run build` reports?
   - Could you have done the same thing without Day.js? Was it worth adding?
     Either answer is fine if you explain your reasoning.

`npm run build` must finish without errors.

## Expected results

Use these to check your work after TODO 3. All of them assume you have not
adopted or returned anything since the last refresh.

| Filter | Sort | Cards shown, in order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All | Original order | Luna, Biscuit, Pepper, Moose, Charly, Bill, Chompers, Beowulf |
| All | Name | Beowulf, Bill, Biscuit, Charly, Chompers, Luna, Moose, Pepper |
| Available | Original order | Luna, Moose, Charly, Chompers |
| Available | Age | Chompers, Luna, Charly, Moose |
| Adopted | Age | Bill, Pepper, Biscuit, Beowulf |

The count starts at **4 of 8 animals are available for adoption.**

Arrival dates after TODO 4:

| Animal | Arrived |
| --- | --- |
| Luna | Aug 20, 2026 |
| Biscuit | Jun 2, 2026 |
| Pepper | Jul 15, 2026 |
| Moose | Sep 10, 2026 |
| Charly | Sep 28, 2026 |
| Bill | Aug 3, 2026 |
| Chompers | Oct 1, 2026 |
| Beowulf | May 11, 2026 |

## Extra credit (up to +3 points)

Extra credit is for students who finish the required tasks and want to go
further. **It is only graded if the required tasks work.** A broken required
feature can't be made up with an extra one.

Each feature below is worth **1 point**, up to a maximum of **3 points**. To
count, a feature must:

- work completely, without console errors;
- still work together with the filters, sort, count, and loading;
- be commented in your own words; and
- be listed in the **EXTRA CREDIT** comment at the top of `script.js`.

Extra credit features from Assignment 3 don't count again.

1. **Dog photos.** The [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) returns a random
   photo of a breed from `https://dog.ceo/api/breed/BREED/images/random`. After
   the animals load, request a photo for every dog that has a `breed`, store
   each photo URL on its animal, and show it on the card with useful `alt`
   text. Request the photos **at the same time** with `Promise.all()`, not one
   after another. Photos must not change when the user filters, sorts, or
   adopts. If a photo request fails, the card still appears without a photo.
2. **Try again.** Add a **Try again** button to the error message that loads
   the animals again without refreshing the page.
3. **Saving....** Pretend each adoption is sent to a server. Write a function
   `wait(ms)` that returns a Promise that resolves after `ms` milliseconds
   (use `setTimeout`). When the user clicks **Adopt** or **Return**, disable the
   button and change its text to `Saving...`, `await wait(1000)`, then change
   the animal.
4. **Newest arrivals.** Add a **Newest arrival** option to the sort menu that
   orders animals by `intakeDate`, most recent first. It must work with every
   filter.
5. **A second package.** Install and use another npm package that adds a
   feature, such as [canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti)
   when an animal is adopted or [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) for a
   forgiving name search. Add it to the dependency check in your
   **About this project** section.
6. **Format with npm.** Install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as a dev
   dependency, add a `"format": "prettier --write ."` script, and run
   `npm run format`. Explain in your **About this project** section why
   Prettier is a dev dependency.
7. **Your own idea.** A feature of similar size that you design. **Ask me
   before you start** so I can confirm it counts.

## Comment your code

**Comments are graded.** Add comments in your own words explaining what your
new code does and why, including the two required comments in TODO 3. Comments
that only restate the code, like `// fetch the animals` above a `fetch()`
line, don't count.

## Debugging tips

- **The console says `animals is not defined` when you type `animals`.** That's
  expected. With `type="module"`, variables in `script.js` stay inside the
  file instead of becoming global. Use `console.log(animals)` in your code
  instead.
- **`npm` isn't recognized, or Vite says your Node version is too old.**
  Install the current LTS version of Node and restart VS Code.
- **`npm run dev` says `Missing script: "dev"`.** Check the `"scripts"` section
  of `package.json` (TODO 1, step 3). Watch for missing commas and quotes.
- **`Failed to resolve module specifier "dayjs"`.** You opened the page with
  Live Server, or you haven't run `npm install dayjs`. Use the `npm run dev`
  address.
- **Vite shows an error over the page.** Read it. It names the file and line
  with the problem, usually a typo.
- **The page doesn't change after you save.** Make sure `npm run dev` is still
  running in the terminal.
- **You cloned the project onto another computer and nothing runs.** Run
  `npm install` first to recreate `node_modules`.

## Commit and push

Make **at least three commits of your own** while working. The starter commit
does not count. Write messages that explain what changed, for example:

- `Run the project with Vite`
- `Load animals from animals.json`
- `Show arrival dates with Day.js`

Push before you submit:

```
git push
```

## Before you submit
